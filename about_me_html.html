            <p>Hi! I'm Isaac! I am a graphic designer and photographer from South Eastern Massachusetts. Currently I go to school in Manchester, NH. I specialize in macro photography, especially that of jewelry. Within graphic design I enjoy doing magazine design. </p>  <p> Within my personal life I am chronically ill with multiple rare and commonly misdiagnosed illnesses including Classical-like Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Paroxysmal Hemicrania, and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Having these illness has led me to experience the world in a different way. </p><p> In high shcool I actually had a major which always seems to confuse people. I majored in Marine Sciences. Within Marine Sciences I focused on the behavior of fish and invertebrates. I would also occasionally dabble into canine behavior as well as livestock judging and handling, especially dairy cattle. </p>
